### Issues Resolved

#### 1) Access Token Expired : API throwing a 500 error.Message states that access token expired.
#### 2) Request password : the program does not appropriately handle password request failures. Users may run into the problems when ####they try to retrieve their password or seek a password reset
#### 3) Login page Issue :the login page lacks any substantial validation and bad error feedback if invalid credentials are entered. ####Either the users are not notified properly, or they are given some generic error that hinders debugging or comprehending the issue.
#### 4)Url Issue : the application does not verify whether a given string (for profile links, social URLs) is in a correct URL format.
#### 5)Token Issue: when a JWT token is requested (through login or other authentication methods), the API does not handle some edge cases properly.
